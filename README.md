# Covariates_selection

This repository contents code to reproduce the simulation results of the thesis "New covariates selection approaches in high dimensional or functional regression models" for covariates selection implementation. In particular, code and real examples of Freijeiro-González et al. (2022) and Freijeiro-González et al. (2023) are collected in **_Linear Regression_** and **_Functional Concurrent Model_** folders, respectively. See mi ResearchGate profile for more details: https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Laura-Freijeiro-Gonzalez.
